<em>With so many skin care products on the market and so much advice out there a question like 'what is the best skincare routine when using face masks?' becomes a lot trickier than you think...</em>

## Applying Skincare Products In The Right Order
To get the most out of your skin care products its important to develop a skincare routine that ensures you are applying them in the correct order. So, when to apply a face mask? Before or after a shower? Before or after moisturiser? Before or after applying toner? What should you do before applying a face mask? And what about after applying a face mask - should you wash your face? Read on and we'll do our best to shine some light on a tricky subject...

## Skin Care Routine Steps : Makeup Remover - Cleanser - Toner - Face Mask - Everything Else
Although they can be broken down further, to simplify our approach to a perfect skincare routine we've highlighted the most important categories. 

Step one in any skin care routine is to remove any existing makeup. This will make sure that any new product applied to the face will be absorbed into the skin. Step two is to apply cleanser to remove any dirt or oils. Applying toner might not be a part of every routine but this optional step three will rebalance your skin prior to applying a face mask. 

Step four is the all important step - masking! After applying toner, apply your face mask before any serum and before moisturising. If using a sheet mask, line up the eyes nose and mouth holes and press on from the forehead down. Don't forget to use up any valuable remaining serum by rubbing it into your neck and arms.

## How long should I leave a face mask on for?
Its important to follow the instructions on the packaging however as a general rule face masks should be left on for between 10 and 20 minutes.

## How often should you use face masks
Can you use face masks every day? This really depends on a lot of factors such as the type of mask and your skin type. As a general rule we recommend applying a mask no more than three times a week (which is why our **[largest subscription](https://www.thefacepack.com/subscribe)** is for twelve masks - three a week for a month) as with the answer to "How long should I leave a mask on for?" above, the best bet is to check the manufacturer's guidance on the packaging.

## What to do after applying a face mask
Should I wash my face after a face mask? No! Whilst its necessary to rinse after using certain types of mask such as clay masks you should not cleanse or wash your face.The essence from a sheet mask is also designed to remain on the skin and continue to work its magic so washing your face with cleanser or soap right after a face mask is a generally bad idea.
