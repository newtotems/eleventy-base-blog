![Spotlight on Bielenda, Polish rinse and peel beauty mask brand](https://www.thefacepack.com/img/blog/spotlight-bielenda-rinse-peel-masks.jpg#title)

<em>In the first of our Spotlight series - where we take a look at the best sheet, rinse and peel beauty face mask brands from all over the world - we're focussing on <strong>Bielenda</strong>, a hot beauty and skin care brand from Poland specialising in rinse and peel off masks utilising a large variety of ingredients and textures...</em>

## The Bielenda Story
Bielenda is a family cosmetics company founded in 1990 by Barbara Bielenda, a graduate of the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Gdansk. They have been developing skin care products for over 25 years from their headquarters in Krakow, Poland. 

## Unique Skin Care Ingredients
The thing we love most about Bielenda is their approach to ingredients - they believe that the best and safest skin care is obtained using all natural active ingredients and they have gone all in on this philosophy, sourcing an unbelievably wide variety of unique skin care ingredients. For example...

Their **Crystal Glow** range is crystal and stone themed - using black onyx, rose quartz, jadeite, ruby and more as their base. 

The **Botanical Clays** line relies on the botanicals Aloe and Acai to provide skin with a rich source of nutrients such as Vitamins C, E and B as well as magnesium, calcium, zinc and ferulic acid.

Other face mask products feature such tasty ingredients as black sugar, manuka honey, black and green teas, mango, broccoli, beetroot and oats. Skin Shot takes this further with included ampoules of ground coffe beans, rice powder, matcha tea, lemon salt and more.

## Texture Tuesday And Every Other Day
Bielenda is famous for adding scrub and exfoliation into the masking mix and they produce an even amount of both rinse off, clay and peel off masks as well as the always fun to use bubble masks. Mask textures also range from course luffa to fine metallic particles.

## Modern And Moral
Safety and ethics are a big part of the Bielenda philosophy and as such they never test products on animals and only use products from Certified Crops and ecologically approved ingredients. They hold an ISO 14001 certificate which is an international standard for environmental management aimed at minimizing the impact of business on the environment.

## Experience Bielenda With The Face Pack Subscription
One of the most recognized brands in Poland, Bielenda cosmetics are also available in over 45 countries around the world, and of course as we love Bielenda so much you're likely to see one or two Bielenda face masks pop up in your monthly skin care subscription from **The Face Pack**. 

But which mask will you get? The fun part is finding out!
