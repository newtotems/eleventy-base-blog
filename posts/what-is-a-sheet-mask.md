<em>Sheet masks have exploded in popularity recently but what are they, how do they work and what sheet mask is best?</em>

## What is a sheet mask?
You may not be sure what they are but you've seen them. No doubt you've seen them. 

Sheet masks are all over Instagram, celebrities such as January Jones, Victoria Beckham, Lady Gaga and many more swear by them and they have become synonymous with the phrase K-Beauty.

Unlike rinse off masks or peel off masks, sheet masks deliver active skin care ingredients via a cotton fibre, paper, Biocellulose, Hydrogel, rubber or foil sheet which is shaped to cover your face. This means you can simply take the mask off when done with no need to wash off paste or gel.

Sheet masks are normally single use and come in an endless supply of cool packaging.

## How do you use sheet masks?
Sheet masks are easy to use - simply take the mask out of the pack, place over a clean face and leave it there for 10-30 minutes depending on the instructions so the serum can be absorbed into the skin. Apply the mask top down, sticking to your forehead at first and then ensuring the eye and mouth holes sit in the right place. Generally sheet masks are one size fits all, if you find yours is on the big side then you can tuck the sides, this helps stop the mask sliding off of your face. Once the time is up, remove the mask and pat the excess serum from the mask and pack onto any other parts of your body you think need an extra boost such as neck and hands.

## How often can I use a sheet mask?
You can use sheet masks as often as you like. If you are a member of **[The Face Pack](https://www.thefacepack.com/)** then you have the option of receiving masks to use once a week (The Fantastic Four subscription), twice a week (The Excellent Eight subscription) or three times a week (The Terrific Twelve subscription)

## What do sheet masks do for skin?
Sheet masks are infused with serum and depending on the mask and brand the different active ingredients can have many effects such as brightening, moisturising and soothing.

## Do sheet masks really work?
Whilst masks and masking alone are not likely to drastically improve poor skin, they do provide the important function of delivering active ingredients for the skin to absorb. The active ingredients can have a soothing, exfoliating or moisturising effect. They can also help protect the skin from premature aging and damage from free radicals such as polluting chemicals in the air.

## Where do sheet masks come from?
Whilst sheet masks are a staple of Korean beauty routines they are by no means limited to Korean brands. There are hundreds if not throusands of skin care face mask brands all over the world, **[Bielenda](https://www.thefacepack.com/posts/spotlight-on-bielenda/)** from Poland and even **[W7](https://www.w7makeup.co.uk/)** in the UK for example.
