<em>The Face Pack is the ultimate sheet, rinse and peel **face mask [subscription service](https://www.thefacepack.com/subscribe)**, here's a little bit about how we're different...</em>

## Not Just Sheet Masks
Whilst we looove a sheet mask and the majority of our subscription features the best sheet masks from around the world, we didn't want you to miss out on the immense variety of other mask types out there. That's why you'll find a selection of sheet, rinse, bubble, gel and peel face masks in your subscription.

## From All Over The World
No doubt about it, Korea made masking popular and Korean sheet masks are top quality. That's why there will be loads of them in your **Face Pack [subscription](https://www.thefacepack.com/subscribe)** to discover! But there is a whole world of skin care out there and we'll be including the best face masks from Europe, Asia and USA as well.

## Every Package Is Different
And we mean every package! We don't do themed packages - we're a discovery service and our theme is and always will be "The best masks from around the world". We're also about variety which is why everyone gets a different selection in their package every month. What will you discover?
