                        <p>The Face Pack monthly subscription service is, well… monthly! We post your first pack out on the first working day after you sign up for your beauty box subscription (so there is no waiting to start that new skin care routine!) and then we send your packages on the same day every month.</p>
                        <p>For example, if you sign up for The Face Pack on the 5th of October - we post your first package out on the 6th of October, your second package on the 6th of November and so on.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>You will be billed monthly on the date you started your subscription.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Monthly beauty subscription boxes make an excellent gift and sending someone special a selection of the best sheet, rinse and peel beauty facial masks from around the world to discover every month will likely get you plenty of brownie points.
                        </p>
                        <p>You can absolutely send our monthly subscription packs out as a gift, just change the delivery address to that of the person you’d like to receive the gift. It's important to remember that you are the owner of the subscription and so it's you who will have to pay monthly and who will need to cancel the subscription.</p>

                        <p>Inside your shiny monthly subscription pack you will find a selection of either four, eight or twelve beauty facial masks depending on the selection you made during signup. The selection will be split between sheet masks, rinse off masks and peel off masks and the split will vary each month. Sometimes you’ll get more masks (because we like to treat our pack members when we can!) but you’ll never get less than the stated amount. Occasionally we may mix things up and add novel items we think you’d love such as eye masks or lip masks.</p>
